<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

These feedbacks gives us an insight on customers expectations to our website and feedbacks to our further improvements. 
In order to measure our success, we are required to calculate the amount of sales volume, so that the rate of revenue can be increased.

Our target audiences are all ages, from children to elderlies that have a passion for ice-creams, but the web site will be focusing more to attract children and their families by using attractive colours and active use of media and animations to be children friendly.
